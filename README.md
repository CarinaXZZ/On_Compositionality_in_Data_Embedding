# On Compositionality in Data Embedding
This research focuses on investigating the compositionality within sentence and knowledge graph embeddings. A learned embedding is compositional when it can represent complex concepts or items by combining simple attributes. In this research, we mainly look into additive compositionality. More details of this research will be published at [IDA 2023](https://ida2023.org).
